                <blockquote>
                    <h3>My Skills</h3>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>1</sup>When it comes to my skills, I honestly don’t know how to define them.
                    <sup>2</sup><mark style="background-color:burlywood;">To me, a skill is something I can do confidently, something I have mastered or can rely on without hesitation.</mark>
                    <sup>3</sup>That’s why I sometimes hesitate to call certain things my skills.
                    <sup>4</sup>However, there are things I am capable of doing, and over time, I’ve realized that they do count as my strengths.

                    <sup>5</sup>For life skills, I consider self-awareness, creativity, and empathy to be some of my strongest traits.
                    <sup>6</sup>I am highly aware of my emotions and how they affect my decisions.
                    <sup>7</sup>Creativity has always been a part of me, whether in storytelling, designing, or even problem-solving.
                    <sup>8</sup>Empathy allows me to connect with people on a deeper level, understanding their emotions and perspectives, which helps in both personal and academic settings.

                    <sup>9</sup>When it comes to technical skills, I have a fair understanding of programming.
                    <sup>10</sup>I’m quite confident in HTML and CSS, as I’ve spent time learning and practicing them.
                    <sup>11</sup>However, for other programming languages, I feel like I still have a long way to go.
                    <sup>12</sup>I enjoy coding, but I know there’s so much more to learn.
                    <sup>13</sup>Despite that, I’m eager to improve and expand my knowledge in different areas of programming.

                    <sup>14</sup>One skill that I take the most pride in is writing stories.
                    <sup>15</sup>Writing has always been my escape, a way to express my thoughts and emotions freely.
                    <sup>16</sup>I remember a time when I wrote a whole 30+ chapter story, completely immersing myself in the world I created.
                    <sup>17</sup>It felt so fulfilling to bring my ideas to life through words.
                    <sup>18</sup>Along with writing, I have an endless passion for reading.
                    <sup>19</sup>I can spend hours buried in a book or a novel, sometimes even reading until the sun rises without realizing how much time has passed.

                    <sup>20</sup>I also love learning new things and challenging myself in different ways.
                    <sup>21</sup>Whether it’s picking up a new hobby, trying out a different style of writing, or even experimenting with new programming techniques, I always want to push myself further.
                    <sup>22</sup>Though I may not be confident in all my skills yet, I believe that with time, practice, and dedication, I will continue to grow and improve.

            <!--------------- HOBBIES ----------------------->
            <p class="hobbies">
                <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Now, though, I’ve combined one of my skills and my hobbies.
                <sup>2</sup>I took my old stories and turned them into a full web page.
                <sup>3</sup>At first, it was difficult because the stories were too long, but I persevered and eventually finished it.

                <sup>4</sup>I also discovered a love for journaling, Although I've done it in the past—I still find it therapeutic.
                <sup>5</sup>Every day, I write about how my day went, what I felt, and what I did.
                <sup>6</sup>It’s rewarding to read back on old entries—it feels nostalgic, and sometimes, past emotions resurface.
                <sup>7</sup>I think I started journaling because I was struggling with coding.
                <sup>8</sup>I was so frustrated that I needed an outlet, and journaling became my release.

                <sup>9</sup>Another hobby I pursued is jewelry-making.
                <sup>10</sup>I originally started it with the idea of turning it into a business, but I was too busy at the time, so it never took off.
                <sup>11</sup>However, I kept making bracelets, and even now, I continue creating more because, in my mind, the business will happen someday.
                <sup>12</sup>I just need to be patient and go with the flow for now.

                <sup>13</sup>In my free time, I also read and enjoy coding—specifically, making games!
                <sup>14</sup>Yes, games have become one of my biggest hobbies.
                <sup>15</sup>I bought Minecraft, Stardew Valley, and many more.
                <sup>16</sup>I think gaming became a hobby for me because I was so stressed with our thesis that journaling alone wasn’t enough.
                <sup>17</sup>That’s how I found myself immersed in the gaming world.

                <sup>18</sup>I play gacha games like Wuthering Waves, Genshin Impact, Punishing Gray Raven, and many more.
                <sup>19</sup>I also enjoy mind games like Chess, Checkers, Wordle, Word Search, and Sudoku.
                <sup>20</sup>These days, I pretty much play any game that catches my interest.
                <sup>21</sup>If I see a game in an ad and I will immediately install it, and probably play it for half a day, become obsessed for a week, and then move on to the next one.

                <sup>22</sup>Because of that, gaming has become a significant part of my life, alongside my other creative hobbies.

            <!--------------- INTEREST ----------------------->
            <p class="interest">
                <h3>My Interest</h3>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<sup>1</sup>I've always loved working with my hands and creating things from scratch.
                <sup>2</sup>There’s something incredibly satisfying about taking simple materials and turning them into something unique and personal.
                <sup>3</sup>Whether it's crafting, drawing, or designing, I enjoy the process of bringing ideas to life.
                <sup>4</sup>It allows me to be creative and express myself in ways that words sometimes cannot.
                <sup>5</sup>Seeing a finished product that I made from start to finish gives me a deep sense of accomplishment.

                <sup>6</sup>Lately, I've developed a strong interest in crochet, DIY bags, drawing, and making notepads.
                <sup>7</sup>Crochet fascinates me because of how a simple strand of yarn can be turned into something beautiful and functional.
                <sup>8</sup>I want to learn different stitches and patterns to make cute accessories, small pouches, or even cozy scarves.
                <sup>9</sup>Making DIY Bags is another thing I find exciting.
                <sup>10</sup>I love the idea of mixing colored big chuncky year, and different materials to create unique designs that reflect my personality.

                <sup>11</sup>Every piece I create feels special because it’s made with effort and creativity.
                <sup>12</sup>It’s amazing how something as simple as a handmade Bag or a crocheted item can hold sentimental value.
                <sup>13</sup>These Interest give me a sense of purpose and joy, especially when I see my progress over time.
                <sup>14</sup>They also challenge me to be patient, as crafting takes time and practice to perfect.
                <sup>15</sup>Each mistake I make is just another learning experience that helps me improve.

                <sup>16</sup>Drawing has always been something I enjoy, but I'm still learning and improving.
                <sup>17</sup>I want to experiment with different styles and techniques to bring my ideas to life.
                <sup>18</sup>Using a tablet to draw is also something I’m exploring because it allows for more creative possibilities.
                <sup>19</sup>Along with that, I’m interested in making my own notepads.
                <sup>20</sup>There’s something special about having a personalized notebook that I crafted myself, whether for jotting down thoughts, sketches, or important notes.

                <sup>21</sup>I love the process of creating something by hand because it feels rewarding and personal.
                <sup>22</sup>These hobbies allow me to express myself and bring my ideas into reality.
                <sup>23</sup>I also enjoy the fact that they are relaxing and help me de-stress after a long day.
                <sup>24</sup><mark style="background-color:burlywood;">There's so much to learn, and I’m excited to keep improving my skills and trying new things.</mark>
                <sup>25</sup>Every new project is a step forward, and I can’t wait to see how much I can grow.
